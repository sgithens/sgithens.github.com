        <h1>Boxer Godot WASM</h1>
        <p>
            This is the first successful build of <a href="./Boxer Godot release.html">Boxer Godot WASM</a>, compiled
            on January 23rd, 2026.  This is the full Boxer evaluator and primitives compiled to a C library using
            Embedded Common Lisp and used
            to power an in-progress frontend written in Godot.  Here we are using a static C library with our Godot
            extension compiled in as a full Godot <code>modules</code>, rather than as a GDExtension.
        </p>
        <p>Many things dont work, and a lot of the keybindings aren't going through, but you can evaluate with
           Control-Enter.  The WASM binary is quite large at the moment (50megs).  Many things will be straightforward
           from this point to cleanup having wrangled an initial build. Additionally, this <em>IS</em> multithreaded,
           with the Boxer Evaluator Runtime running in it's own thread apart from the Godot main event loop/renderer,
           with 2 queues linking them in each direction.
