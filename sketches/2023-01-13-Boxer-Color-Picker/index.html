        <h1>Color Picker for Boxer</h1>
        <p>
        This is a simple barebones color picker for Boxer, based off Andy's
        Wayfaring in colorspace, mostly by removing extra stuff and pasting in
        a color picker-ish looking color wheel.  Any image can be used as the
        wheel really, by flipping graphics box and running:
        <code><pre>change-graphics self new-image-boxname</pre></code>
        </p>
        <p>
        The resulting patch color can be copied and used anywhere else a Boxer color
        is needed.
        </p>
