        <h1>BoxFile Resursive Saving</h1>
        <em>Do Sub Box Files get saves when the enclosing box is saved?</em>

        <p>In Boxer a box can be marked as a file box, which means that particular
            box is saved to a file on disk.  Like any other boxer asset, you can have
            file boxes inside of other boxes.  When you issue a Save command, Boxer
            will look for the closest file box upwards from the location of the cursor
            and save that box. However, if you have file boxes inside of that box, though
            they need to have save commands issued themselves in order to save their
            contents.
