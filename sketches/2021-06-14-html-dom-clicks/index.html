        <h1>HTML Dom Click types</h1>

        <p>
            Currently we are working on revising the mouse click magic event names
            in Boxer. At the moment there is only "mouse-click" and "mouse-double-click".
            And actually the mouse click is more like mouse down since it will get
            invoked if you hold the button down for a bit and don't let up. This is a small
            sketch to take a look at the behavior of the HTML DOM events click, dblclick,
            mousedown, and mouseup.  Usually when possible I try to map new things closely
            to the modern browser model as many are familiar with it and I believe it represents
            a good set of tradeoffs.

            You can open the javascript console and click in this document to view the event order.

            Interestingly, if you double click, the regular click events for each click still get
            triggered. The result of Double Clicking is: (same in firefox, chrome, and safari)
