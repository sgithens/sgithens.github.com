        <h1>Boxer Paint</h1>
        <p>
            In the early 2010's, Boxer graphics canvas was transitioned from various graphics canvases provided by
            various lisp distributions to OpenGL, a number of things didn't quite get patched up during this transition.
            One of these was support for the "follow-mouse" primitive which until fixing it today, locked up the system.
            With this fixed we can now implement the trivial canonical Boxer Paint program.  Screenshot and box file
            below.
